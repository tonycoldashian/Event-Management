# Event-Management
Database Project - Event Mangement System
This is my first project using these tools.
Project is done using PHP, HTML and CSS using XAMPP server.
The event management comapany assigns a userid for the user and they have to register using that in the register page and login.
Customer can select their preferences for each category of the event - Event type, venue, Food, Transporation, Entertainment etc.
The manager assigned to the customer can update this and confirm the data.
once confirmed, the total amount will be displayed and user can opt for online payment.
